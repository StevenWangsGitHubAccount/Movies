# Movies
This is a web application built with SQL, React, Express.js, Node.js, and Selenium. The user selects an option--e.g., best movies with a selected genre, movie recommendations similar to a movie inputs, top-rated genres for a selected decade--and the app queries a SQL database and returns the results.
